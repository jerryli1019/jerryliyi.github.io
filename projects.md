## Group Projects:
- **DataHacks 2021**: [[html page](https://weiyueli7.github.io/DataHacks2021/Beginner_TheBalds_code.html)], [[report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPIDtfS09ARYrcbHsIdaK3z5zeXteL4N/view?usp=sharing)], [[source code](https://github.com/weiyueli7/DataHacks2021)]. Time: April 2021.

 My first experience with DataHacks hosted by the [DS3](https://ds3.ucsd.edu/) Organization at UCSD. Even though we were the runner-ups for the beginner track, this project is still pretty naive. However, it is still one of our greatest memories as freshmen at UCSD because we have accomplished this project with average of 0.5 year of coding experience.
 
 - **CalCOFI 2021**: [[source code](https://github.com/jerryli1019/Oceanography-Data-Analysis)]. Time: March 2021.

 My first experience with [CalCOFI](https://calcofi.org/). As participants of this data analysis event, we were assigned to the data cleaning group. Although this project is not perfectly done, we successfully performed linear regression and OLS regression report. Hopefully, we can make more progress in the future!
