## Group Projects:
- DataHacks 2021: [[html page](https://weiyueli7.github.io/DataHacks2021/Beginner_TheBalds_code.html)], [[report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPIDtfS09ARYrcbHsIdaK3z5zeXteL4N/view?usp=sharing)], [[source code](https://github.com/weiyueli7/DataHacks2021)]. Time: April 2021.

 My first experience with DataHacks hosted by the [DS3](https://ds3.ucsd.edu/) Organication at UCSD. Even though we were the runner-ups for the beginner track, this project is still pretty naive. However, it is one of my greatest memory as a freshman at UCSD because we have accomplished this project with average of 0.5 year of coding experience.
